## Overview

True Chess is a basic representation of a chessboard with pieces, providing a visual interface for a chess game. The project uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling game logic.

## Installation

No specific installation is required for this project. Simply clone the repository or download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess.git

## File Structure
